# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python & MySQL

This project performs a full pipeline of COVID-19 case analysis using Python, web scraping, and MySQL for data storage. It retrieves and processes pandemic data from HTML sources, stores structured records in a MySQL database, and generates meaningful visualizations to uncover patterns such as infection trends, recovery rates, and country-level comparisons.

Built using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, the project is modular and split into classes for handling scraping, requests, file I/O, database operations, and data analysis.
